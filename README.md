ANN from scratch in C++

I'm building this ANN header only library from scratch in C++. Mostly to better understand the ANN itself.\
If you want to help, then you are more than welcome to try :+1:
- I didn't use more optimized 3rd party matrix library. So it's kinda slow but keeps things original
- No try and catch. To make my code more readable
- Currently I only implemented SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with three optimizers:
  - Simple derivative form
  - Momentum
  - AdaGrad

PS:
  I used the word "delta" instead of "gradient"!
